A filesystem organizes a computerâ€™s files and directories into a tree structure:

- The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
- Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files. In a filesystem blog/ is the parent of 2014/, 2015/, and hardware.txt.
- Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as directories and files are nested.

The Mac Finder and Windows Explorer represent the filesystem as trees as well.
