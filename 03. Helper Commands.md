<b>clear</b> is used to clear your terminal, which is useful when it’s full of previous commands and outputs. It doesn’t change or undo your previous commands, it just clears them from the view. You can scroll upwards to see them at any time.

<b>tab</b> can be used to autocomplete your command. When you are typing the name of an existing file or directory, you can use tab to finish the rest of the name.

The up and down arrows (<b>↑ and ↓</b>) can be used to cycle through your previous commands. ↑ will take you up through your most recent commands, and ↓ will take you back through to the most recent one.
