A command is a directive to the computer to perform a specific task. 
In the terminal, the first thing you see is $. This is called a shell prompt. It appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command.

## ls
When you type ls, the command line looks at the directory you are in, and then “lists” all the files and directories inside of it.

## pwd

pwd, which stands for “print working directory.” It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the working directory.

## cd

cd, which stands for “change directory.” Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer or Finder, cd switches you into the directory you specify. In other words, cd changes the working directory.
When a file, directory, or program is passed into a command, it is called an argument. Here the 2021 directory is an argument for the cd command.

The cd command takes a directory name as an argument and switches into that directory.

To move up one directory, we use cd ..

```
$ cd 2021 
//2021 is the directory that you want to select
```

```
$ cd 2021/jan
// The system will change directory to jan
```

```
$ cd ../...
// The file system will traverse up 2 levels
```


## mkdir

The mkdir command stands for “make directory”. It takes in a directory name as an argument and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.

```
$ mkdir media
```

If we wanted to create another directory inside that one, we could cd into media and then use mkdir, or we could make the new directory from our current position by using a / to combine arguments as we did in the last lesson.

```
$ mkdir media/tv
```

## touch

```
$ touch keyboard.txt

```

The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument and then creates an empty file with that name in the current working directory.
